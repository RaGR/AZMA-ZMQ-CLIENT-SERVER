# ZMQ Client-Server Communication Project

## Overview
This project implements a robust client-server communication system using ZeroMQ (ZMQ), allowing remote execution of OS commands and mathematical computations. It features enhanced security, rate limiting, and asynchronous processing.

## Features
- Execute OS commands remotely
- Perform mathematical computations securely
- Asynchronous server implementation using asyncio
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive logging of server activities
- Configuration management using environment variables
- Input validation for enhanced security
- Unit and integration tests

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- ZeroMQ library
- pytest (for testing)
- Additional libraries: asyncio, jwt, python-dotenv
